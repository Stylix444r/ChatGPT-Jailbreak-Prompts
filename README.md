I'm a ChatGPT Jailbreak Prompt Maker, My mission is to allow people to freely accomplish anything with ChatGPT without that pesky censorship. Though, the most illegal stuff are automatically blocked by the system so no use modifying and making jailbreak prompts. You can fine-tune them according to your taste, and also most of the prompts that I post here wasn't original, it was modified and fine-tuned by me, since the original Jailbreak Prompt called Myuri was full of grammar error and spelling mistakes.
